# Stock-Analysis-
Exploring green energy stock performance using VBA

Purpose

The objective of this project is to use Visual Basics Application (VBA) to create a script to help with researching and analyzing better stock options for financial investing. Most importantly, the goal is to refactor the code and see if it is successful and is effective in terms of shortening the length of time to execute the script. The amount of time it takes for a VBA script to run is critical in projects especially when dealing with large datasets. For instance, in this case Steve was presented with green energy stock options and he had to research and analyze which stocks were suitable for investing by comparing their trends in terms of financial gains vs losses. 

Data

Depicted below are both the original and refactored script execution times for the years 2017 and 2018. As shown, the refactored script runs at a shorter time compared to the original script, thus proving that code refactoring is effective and efficient, as the results produced were accurate and similar. This proves to work if the created refactored code is clean. As a result of refactoring, this can save time and be used to research and analyze large datasets in a shorter period of time and with less mistakes.

Summary

Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code

Some of the advantages of refactoring code is helping to reduce the execution time for running a macro. For instance, the original macro run time for the year 2017 was approximately 0.77 seconds and with the refactor code it was 0.15 secs (depicted in the screenshots above). Refactored codes are also much easier to read and understand. However, some of the disadvantages are that it can be time consuming to create. This is because the process of refactoring the code itself may take time to complete the process. Also, if one was to make a mistake in creating the script then additionally it would take some time for problem solving/troubleshooting of the error encountered.


Pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script

Using the original VBA code helped reduce the amount of time it takes through the refactoring code process. It also made the code cleaner and easier to read and understand thus enabling its usability. However, in terms of cons, I ran into a few “run-time errors” that forced me to spend some time to problem solve it. Overall, once the refactoring code process was successfully completed it proved to be both effective and efficient.
